    <h2>My Web Work</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Below are some of the websites and landing pages I've designed and coded. Every project teaches me something new and makes me want to learn more and try&nbsp;new&nbsp;things. With a background in design I've been lucky enough to also get to design each of these pages. I really enjoy getting to work on each project from concept to&nbsp;completion.</p>

        <h2>Luminant Music</h2>
        <p>This website was a complete overhaul. I took the original content and first sketched out a few wireframes to help wrap my mind around the organization. Once I was happy with the flow I started thinking look.  I was going for modern and very solid on color and eye catching. Then it was just a matter of building it out piece by piece and testing, testing, testing.<br><br>
        They have updated the look a few times since then. Below is the link to what I originally created.</p>

        <h2>Cavista</h2>
        <p>This was another website overhaul. Thier goal was create a new look that would mainly attract more talent. I had 2 weeks to design and code this new website. Luckily the design didn't require too many edits and the website was fairly simple. </p>

        <h2>Scuba Kev</h2>
        <p>What better way to create a scuba diving website then to make it look like your moving under water. The challenge with this website was the large amount of information to be communicated. I broke it down into sections and added a few visuals to help break up all the information into more manageable pieces.</p>

        <h2>BSN Sports "About Us"</h2>
        <p>The about us page needed a complete redesign and information update. The idea was to design and create this page and use it as baseline for a complete website redesign. This page is done and I am now using it to redesign the BSN website page by page.</p>
